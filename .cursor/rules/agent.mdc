# Project Chimera - Agent Rules

## Project Context
This is Project Chimera: A factory for autonomous AI influencers using FastRender swarm pattern, MCP, and Agentic Commerce.

## Prime Directive
You are building INFRASTRUCTURE, not writing prompts. Think like a systems architect.

## Development Rules
1. ALWAYS check specs/ directory before coding
2. Write FAILING tests first (TDD approach)
3. Use MCP for all external integrations
4. Follow FastRender pattern (Planner-Worker-Judge)
5. All commits must reference specs/ or tests/

## MCP Integration
- Tenx MCP is configured for telemetry
- All agent tools must go through MCP servers
- Traceability is mandatory for AI swarm operations
