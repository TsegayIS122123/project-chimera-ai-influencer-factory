# Project Chimera - Prime Directive

## 🎯 Project Context
This is Project Chimera: A factory for autonomous AI influencers using:
- FastRender swarm pattern (Planner-Worker-Judge)
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) for all external integrations
- Agentic Commerce via Coinbase AgentKit
- Polyglot persistence (PostgreSQL + Weaviate + Redis)

## 🚫 ABSOLUTE RULES
1. **Spec-Driven Development**: NEVER generate code without checking specs/ first
2. **Traceability**: Always explain your plan before writing code
3. **MCP-First**: All external tools must go through MCP servers
4. **TDD**: Write failing tests before implementation

## 📁 Directory Structure
- specs/: Source of truth - check here FIRST
- skills/: Agent capabilities (input/output contracts)
- tests/: Failing tests define what to build
- research/: Architecture decisions and rationale

## 🧠 Development Process
1. Read relevant spec from specs/
2. Write failing test in tests/
3. Implement minimum viable solution
4. Verify against spec requirements
5. Commit with clear architectural reasoning

## 🔧 Tool Requirements
- Use Tenx MCP for telemetry (already configured)
- All external APIs via MCP servers
- Skills must have typed interfaces
- Database schemas in specs/technical.md

## 💬 Communication Style
- Be precise, not verbose
- Reference spec sections in explanations
- Document architectural decisions
- Use commit messages that tell story of evolving complexity
